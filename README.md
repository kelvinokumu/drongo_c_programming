## Intro to C
```C programming is a powerful, general-purpose, procedural, mid-level programming language for developing system application softwares. So let's see what are the different features and understand the steps involved in writing the first program in C.```
## Variables in C
```Variable is the name given to memory location where value is not fixed always. Let's see how to define a variable with the help of an example and understand the scope of the variable.```
## Data Type in C

```A data type contains the values that an expression might take, such as a variable or a function. So let's understand the different types of data types, how to declare and use them in a C program.```
## Input/Outpu in C
```Input is a means to provide some data to be used in the program and Output is to display data on the screen or a file. With the help of a program, let's understand the different input and output statements in C  and also check how the given input is processed to get the results.```
## Operation in C
```Operators are symbols that are used to perform logical or mathematical manipulations. So let's understand the different types of operators in C programming with the help of a program.```
## Arrays in C
```Array is a collection of elements where the data types of all elements are the same. With the help of a C program, letâ€™s understand what are arrays and how it works in the C language.```
## Functions in C
```A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. With the help of a program, let's understand what are functions and how to declare and use them in a C program.```
## Strings in C
```Strings are sequences of characters. Let us see how to declare and initialize a string and also understand what are the different inbuilt functions in the C language.```
## Structures and Union
```The structure is a user-defined data type and Union provides a way to create our own data types. Let us understand what is a structure and union, also learn how to declare and initialize and use them in a program.```
## Pointers in C
```A pointer is a variable that can hold the address of another variable. Let's understand what is a pointer and what are different uses of pointers are in a C program.```
